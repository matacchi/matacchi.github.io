	<h1>Mission Hill Farmers Market Posters</h1>
	<br>
	
	<p> For this project I worked with a client from the Mission Hill Farmers Market to create a poster series that would be fit to be displayed at bus terminals around Boston. Given that Mission Hill has the largest population of college students in Boston, I immediately wanted my posters to appeal to the young adult demographic. I looked at popular fashion and music for inspiration. I really enjoyed experimenting with graffiti typography and doing all of the hand lettering for my posters.</p>
