	<h1>Boston Elite</h1>
	<br>
	
	<p> As assigned in my Typography III class, I have designed a prototype for a print magazine that I have named Boston Elite. The idea for Boston Elite started when I was in a Walgreens in the middle of Boston. I was on my way to work, dressed in my running clothes with headphones in my ears. The only time I have to work out during the week is on my way to work- so yes, I run there. I was checking out a knee brace at the register (due to a recent injury) when the magazines caught my eye. Of the athletic magazines, there were Sports Illustrated, Men’s Health, and Shape Magazine; none of which appealed to me- a 21 year old female athlete who lives in Boston. That’s when it hit me. Why not create a magazine with a young adult, athletic demographic. Even better, why not create a magazine that is specific to Boston, and appeals to both male and female? Would it be possible? Boston Elite is dedicated to accomplishing these goals. In addition to focusing on professional teams like the Boston Bruins, Boston Celtics, Boston Red Sox and the New England Patriots, Boston Elite also gives readers insight on college teams as well as athletic events happening in the area.</p>
