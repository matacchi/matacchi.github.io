	<h1>100 Photographs Poster</h1>
	<br>
	
	<p> For this project, I gathered 100 photographs that I'd developed between September of 2013 and September of 2014. I drew data from all of the photographs and compiled them into sections of what I felt were most interesting/ important. The photographs are first separated by groups of people, then to individual people, to the month the photo was taken, to whether or not I consider it an important photo, its orientation, and the mood of the photo. Though the info graph becomes very busy, the viewer can start to see certain trends happening. For example, many family photos were taken in November because of Thanksgiving. The pattern made became very beautiful which I enjoyed since I believe picture taking and keeping is a beautiful process.</p>
