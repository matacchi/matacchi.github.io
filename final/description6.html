	<h1>Enchroma Rebranding</h1>
	<br>
	
	<p> EnChroma is a California-based company that creates sunglass lenses specifically designed to address color blindness. Researchers, engineers, tech experts, and a board of world-renowned vision scientists work to develop products that will impact the lives of the estimated 300 million people worldwide who have color vision deficiency. Enchroma is currently seen as a tech company specializing in the lense making part of sunglass sales. However, after doing research I believe that they could market themselves to be a much more high fashion company. Redesigning their logo is one important step this process would require and I was very pleased with the final result!</p>
